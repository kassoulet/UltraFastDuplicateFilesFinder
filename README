Ultra Fast Duplicate Files Finder
=================================
  by Gautier Portet <kassoulet gmail com>


Takes a list of file from stdin.
And print the duplicate ones.


example use:

  find ~/ -size +10M | ./UltraFastDuplicateFilesFinder.py

to find duplicates in your home folder, all files more than 10MB.

UltraFastDuplicateFilesFinder compares only the very beginning of the files.
Its sufficient for most uses, but use with caution.

But this way is quite useful to detect duplicates within corrupted media files...


this is public domain.
